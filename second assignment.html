<p>write a short history of javascript<br>
           <P style="background: rgb(234, 0, 255); color:white"> javascript is a programming language that was created by brendam eich in just 10 in
            may 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communication Corporation. the language was 
            originally named "Mocha",but was later renamed to 'liveScript' before finally being named
            "JavaScript".

                 The initial idea behind javaScript was to create a simple scripting language that could
                 be used to add interactivily to web pages.At the time, the web was mostly static, and javaScript 
                 offered a way to make a web pages dynamic and responsive to user input.
