        using copios examples explain the similarities and differences between the var,let
        and const keywords in javascript 
        <p>
    1. const
    const used for declaring variable, which cannot be reassigned to a new value.
     introduced in ES6. example<br/>
     const PI=3.14;<br/>
     in this example, PI is a constant variable with a value of 3.14. if you try to ressign 
     PI, you will get an error: pi=3.14159://Uncaught TypeError:Assignment to constant variable.<br/>

2. var is used to declare a vaiable with function scope or global scope depending
   on where it is declared. Example
     var x= 10;
     console.log(x):// Output:10
     <br/>
     x =20
     console.log(x):// Output:20
     in this example X is a variable declared with var that can be reassigned to a
     new value.<br/>
3. let 
   let is used to declare a block-scoped variable.which can be reassignedto a new 
   value within the same block.Here's an example:
   <br/>
   let x=10;
   if(true){
       let x =20
       console.log(x):// Output:20
   }
  console.log(x):// Output:10<br/>
  in this example x is a variable declared with let thatbhas a block scope. The console
  log(x) inside the if statement outputs 20 because it is referencing the x declared
  within the same block. The console.log(x) outside the if statement outputs 10 because 
  it is referencing the x declared outside the block.<br/>
