    Differences and similarities between ==,===,!=,!==,
    <p style="background: rgb(0, 255, 106); color:black">
        ==(Equality operator): the == operator compares the value of two operands for equality
        after converting both operands to a comon type.<br/>

        ===(strict  equality operator): the === operator also compares the value of two operands
        for equality,but without type coercion.<br/>

        != (inequality operator):the != operator is the opposite of the == operator.it return true
        if the operands are not equal,after type coercion.<br/>

        !==(strict inequality operator): the !== operator is the opposite of the === operator.
        it returns true if the operands are not equal,without type coercion.<br/>
